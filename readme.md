## Prerequisites:
Nodejs

The latest production version should be compiled into public, but one can rebuild it with `npm run buildprod` or `npm run builddev` for a dev version.  
Run `npm run prod` to start the server, go to localhost:3000  
To change the port, make a file called settings.json and set the port as desired - see settings.example.json for an example.
